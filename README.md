Calculator with two options

## Brief:
Create a calculator with two options. One has basic functions and the other has advance functions including square root and power.

## What went well:
Calculator works smoothly and the prompts come up as required and when they are required.

## What I found difficult
Struggled a bit when writing the code for the power and square root functions but then worked out how to write them in the code.
